# KingDomino-Digital-Version
A group project as part of a Software Engineering course to create a Digital version of the boardgame KingDomino.
Worked in a group of 5.
Mainly involved in creating the GUI, implementing the logic of the game (which was also used to implement AI for the game) and handling persistent data (save/load).
Used OOP concepts such as indirection, information expert, low coupling, high cohesion, polymorphism, protected variations, and pure fabrication.
Used : Java
